mapfileFS

a fuse userspace filesystem to store a mapfile in the postgres db and provide
filesystem access to it for mapserver


database trigers should mark the cache as expired when the data changes,

when a mapfile is opened for reading first check for a cache, if found, then
check if expired, if not found or expired, read a new one from the db

cache is a search tree of mapfile id's
each cache being a node of its own


keep track of total cache and put a limit on it, then delete old caches as needed
